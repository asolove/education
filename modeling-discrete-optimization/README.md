Modeling discrete optimization
==============================

This is my work on the Coursera course, as created by Prof. Peter James Stuckey, University of Melbourne.

All programs written+tested with MiniZinc 2.1.2: http://www.minizinc.org/index.html

The problems are copyright Coursera, or Prof. Stuckey, or someone else. The solutions work is my own and available under the MIT license.

Following the course's guidelines, I am posting here my notes, side-projects, and work on the (non-graded) exercises, but not on the graded assignments.
