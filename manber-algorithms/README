Examples and exercises from Udi Manber's "Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach".

5. Design of algorithms by induction
- 2: Evaluating polynomials: src/polynomial.re
- 3: Maximal induced subgraph: 

## Setup

I am using:

- Ocaml 4.02.3
- Opam 1.2.2
- Dune (nee jbuilder) 1.0+beta16
- Reason 3.0.4 @ 731e605

I have not figured out a good way to specify all this and make it easy to
reproduce the environment.

To build and run an individual benchmark:

➜ jbuilder build src/polynomial.re
➜ ./src/_build/default/polynomial.exe

## Todo

- [ ] Figure out jbuilder, put its artifacts outside of src
- [ ] Figure out how to specify versions of dependencies/tools
